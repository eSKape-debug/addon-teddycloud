## About TeddyCloud

[TeddyCloud](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/teddycloud) is an alternative server for your Toniebox, allowing you to host the
cloud services locally. This gives you the control about which data is sent to
the original manufacturer's cloud and allows you to host your own figurine
audio files.
